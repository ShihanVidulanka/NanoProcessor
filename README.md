# NanoProcessor
CS2052 Computer Architecture Nano Processor design

The main task of this lab is to design a 4-bit processor capable of executing  
predefined instructions. The arithmetic unit of the processor only focuses on addition and 
subtraction. The processor comprises the following key components.
* 4-bit Add/Subtract unit
* 3-bit adder
* 3-bit Program Counter (PC)
* k-way b-bit multiplexers
  * 2-way 3-bit multiplexer
  * 2-way 4-bit multiplexer
  * 8-way 4-bit multiplexer
* Register Bank
* Program ROM
* Instruction Decoder

The whole project was completed as a team where lab tasks were evenly divided among the team 
members.
